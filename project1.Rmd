```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
housing <- read_xlsx("~/Stats2/projects/prjoect1/Peter-Gray-Stt-3851/Housing.xlsx")
```



```{r cars}
#summary(housing)
pairs(housing[2:8])

par(mfrow = c(2,2))
lm1 <- lm(housing$price ~ housing$lot  + housing$bedrooms) 
summary(lm1)
plot(lm1)
```

```{r no78}
housing2 <- housing[-74,]
lm2 <- lm(housing2$price ~ housing2$lot  + housing2$bedrooms) 
summary(lm2)
plot(lm2)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
